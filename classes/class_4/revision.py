# . Create a dictionary called student with keys: name, age, school, grade, nationality.
# 2. Use the keys(), values(), and items() methods to print respective parts of the dictionary.
# 3. Use get() to check if the key "hobby" exists; if not, print "No hobby recorded".
# 4. Try accessing a missing key using square brackets [] and handle the KeyError using try-except.
# 5. Write your own function called find key(key) that returns the value of a key from the dictionary
# or None if it doesnâ€™t exist.
